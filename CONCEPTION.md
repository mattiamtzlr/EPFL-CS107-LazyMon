## Added classes / interfaces
- `/.../icmon/graphics/PokemonSelectionMenuGraphics.java`, as it is a type of graphics, it seemed fitting to put it with the other graphics.
- TODO

## Changes to the architecture
- Changed the MAX_LINE_LENGTH constant in Dialog.java to 50, because it looks better to have longer lines.

## Extensions
not really, TODO ?
